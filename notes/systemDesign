Step 1: Requirements clarifications
	. Scope
	. define the end goals

Step 2: System interface definition

Step 3: back-of-the-envelope estimation
	. What scale is expected
	. How much of storage
	. The network bandwidth

Step 4: Defining data model
	. which database system? SQL or NoSQL
	. what kind of block storage to store photos 
	  what kind of distributed file storage system?

Step 5: High-level design
	Draw block diagram with 5-6 boxes representing 
	core components of the sytem.

Step 6: Detailed design
	. How should we partition data to distribute it
	  to multiple databases? same user same database?
	. How to handle hot users?
	. How much and at which layer should we introduce
	  cache 
	. what components need load balancing?

Step 7: Identifying and resolving bottlenecks
	. any single pont of failure? how to mitigate it?
	. enough replicas?
	. enough copyes of services?
	. how to monitor the performance?
