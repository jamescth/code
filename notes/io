IOPS and Throughput

The term IOPS stands for input/output operations per second

If a benchmark isn’t presenting results in IOPS, the other
likely candidate is MB/s (throughput). These two units have
a direct relationship, as average transfer size * IOPS = MB/s.

IOPS - can also translate to response time

However, most workloads are a mixture of different transfer
sizes, which is why the storage ninjas in IT prefer IOPS.
Queue depth refers to the number of outstanding access operations.

Queue Depth

Queue depth refers to the number of outstanding access operations.
In the picture above, each solid line represents one disk operation,
which can be either a read or write. Because three operations 
overlap in the same period, there’s a queue depth of three.

They are built out of multiple Flash chips. It is simplistic to
say that they are RAID 0 inside, but it is somewhat similar. A 
queue of requests can be serviced from multiple Flash chips at 
the same time.

Flash is so fast that the latency between responding to a request
and getting a new request is a significant part of the process.
With a hard disk that reponse/request latency is insignificant 
compared to rotational delay and head seek time. But with an SSD 
that waiting is a much larger percentage. Having a queue of
requests gives the SSD more work to do after it responds to
earlier work.
