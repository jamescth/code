BIND or named is the most widely used Domain Name
System (DNS) software on the Internet

The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for
	Start of Authority (SOA),
		Specifies authoritative information about a DNS zone, 
		including the primary name server, the email of the 
		domain administrator, the domain serial number, and
		several timers relating to refreshing the zone.

		A DNS zone is any distinct, contiguous portion of the
		domain name space in the Domain Name System (DNS) for
		which administrative responsibility has been delegated
		to a single manager.

	IP addresses (A and AAAA),
		A - Address record
		AAAA - IPv6 address record

	SMTP mail exchangers (MX),
		Within Internet message handling services (MHS), a message
		transfer agent[1] or mail transfer agent[2] (MTA) or mail
		relay is software that transfers electronic mail messages
		from one computer to another using a client–server 
		application architecture. An MTA implements both the client
		(sending) and server (receiving) portions of the Simple 
		Mail Transfer Protocol.

Jumbo Frame
	Each Ethernet frame must be processed as it passes through the network. Processing the 
	contents of a single large frame is preferable to processing the same content broken
	up into smaller frames, as this makes better use of available CPU time by reducing
	interrupts. This also minimizes the overhead byte count and reduces the number of
	frames needing to be processed.

	Version - 4 bits, value 4
	Internet Header Length (IHL) - 4 bits, The size of header (including options), the mini is 5 => 5*32 = 160 bits = 20 bytes
	Differentiated Services Code point (DSCP)
		TYpe of service
		Differentiated services or DiffServ is a computer networking architecture that
		specifies a simple and scalable mechanism for classifying and managing network
		traffic and providing quality of service (QoS) on modern IP networks. 

		Commonly used DSCP values
		DSCP value	Hex value	Decimal value	Meaning	Drop probability	Equivalent IP precedence value

	Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) - 2 bits
		allows end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets.

	Total Length - 16 bits
		This 16-bit field defines the entire packet size in bytes, including header and data. 
		The minimum size is 20 bytes (header without data) and the maximum is 65,535 bytes.

	Identification - 16 bits
		This field is an identification field and is primarily used for uniquely identifying
		the group of fragments of a single IP datagram.

	Flags - 3 bits
		A three-bit field follows and is used to control or identify fragments. They are (in order,
		from most significant to least significant):
			bit 0: Reserved; must be zero.[note 1]
			bit 1: Don't Fragment (DF)
			bit 2: More Fragments (MF)
		If the DF flag is set, and fragmentation is required to route the packet, then the packet
		is dropped. This can be used when sending packets to a host that does not have resources 
		to handle fragmentation. It can also be used for path MTU discovery, either automatically
		by the host IP software, or manually using diagnostic tools such as ping or traceroute. 
		For unfragmented packets, the MF flag is cleared. For fragmented packets, all fragments
		except the last have the MF flag set. The last fragment has a non-zero Fragment Offset 
		field, differentiating it from an unfragmented packet.

	Fragment Offset - 13 bits
		The fragment offset field is measured in units of eight-byte blocks. It is 13 bits long
		and specifies the offset of a particular fragment relative to the beginning of the 
		original unfragmented IP datagram. The first fragment has an offset of zero. This allows
		a maximum offset of (213 – 1) × 8 = 65,528 bytes, which would exceed the maximum IP packet
		length of 65,535 bytes with the header length included (65,528 + 20 = 65,548 bytes).

	Time to Live - 8 bits
		An eight-bit time to live field helps prevent datagrams from persisting
		(e.g. going in circles) on an internet. This field limits a datagram's lifetime. 

	Protocol - 8 bits
		this field defines the protocol used in the data portion of the IP datagram. 
			0x01	1	ICMP	Internet Control Message Protocol	RFC 792
			0x02	2	IGMP	Internet Group Management Protocol	RFC 1112
			0x06	6	TCP	Transmission Control Protocol
			0x11	17	UDP	User Datagram Protocol	RFC 768

	Header Checksum - 16 bits
		field is used for error-checking of the header. When a packet arrives at a router,
		the router calculates the checksum of the header and compares it to the checksum
		field. If the values do not match, the router discards the packet.

	Src IP address - 32 bits
	Dest IP address - 32 bits

	Options (if IHL > 5)

	************************************************************************************************
	Fragmentation and reassembly
	Networks with different hardware usually vary not only in transmission speed, but also in the 
	maximum transmission unit (MTU). When one network wants to transmit datagrams to a network with
	a smaller MTU, it may fragment its datagrams. In IPv4, this function was placed at the Internet
	Layer, and is performed in IPv4 routers, which thus require no implementation of any higher
	layers for the function of routing IP packets.

	In contrast, IPv6, the next generation of the Internet Protocol, does not allow routers to perform
	fragmentation; hosts must determine the path MTU before sending datagrams.

	Fragmentation

	or example, a packet of 4,520 bytes, including the 20 bytes of the IP header (without options)
	is fragmented to two packets on a link with an MTU of 2,500 bytes:

	Fragment	Total bytes	Header bytes	Data bytes	"More fragments" flag	Fragment offset (8-byte blocks)
	1		2500		20		2480		1			0
	2		2040		20		2020		0			310
	The total data size is preserved: 2480 bytes + 2020 bytes = 4500 bytes. The offsets are 0 and 0 + 2480/8 = 310.

	On a link with an MTU of 1,500 bytes, each fragment results in two fragments:

	Fragment	Total bytes	Header bytes	Data bytes	"More fragments" flag	Fragment offset (8-byte blocks)
	1		1500		20		1480		1			0
	2		1020		20		1000		1			185
	3		1500		20		1480		1			310
	4		560		20		540		0			495
	Again, the data size is preserved: 1480 + 1000 = 2480, and 1480 + 540 = 2020.

	Reassembly
	A receiver knows that a packet is a fragment if at least one of the following conditions is true:

	The "more fragments" flag is set. (This is true for all fragments except the last.)
	The "fragment offset" field is nonzero. (This is true for all fragments except the first.)

IPv6
	The fixed header starts an IPv6 packet and has a size of 40 octets (320 bits).

	Version - 4 bits, contains 6

	Traffic Class (6+2 bits)
		The bits of this field hold two values. The 6 most-significant bits hold the Differentiated Services (DS)
		field, which is used to classify packets.

		The remaining two bits are used for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)

	Flow Label (20 bits)
		Originally created for giving real-time applications special service.[1] When set to a non-zero value,
		it serves as a hint to routers and switches with multiple outbound paths that these packets should stay
		on the same path, so that they will not be reordered.[6][7] It has further been suggested that the flow
		label be used to help detect spoofed packets.

	Payload Length (16 bits)
		The size of the payload in octets, including any extension headers. The length is set to zero when a
		Hop-by-Hop extension header carries a Jumbo Payload option.

	Next Header (8 bits)
		Specifies the type of the next header. This field usually specifies the transport layer protocol used
		by a packet's payload. When extension headers are present in the packet this field indicates which 
		extension header follows.

	Hop Limit (8 bits)
		Replaces the time to live field of IPv4.

	Src Address (128 bits)

	Dest Address (128 bits)

	************************************************************************************************
	Extension Headers

	Hop-by-hp options and destination options
	he Hop-by-Hop Options extension header needs to be examined by all nodes on the packet's path, 
	including sending and receiving nodes. 

	Routing
	The Routing extension header is used to direct a packet to one or more intermediate nodes 
	before being sent to its destination.

	Fragment
	In order to send a packet that is larger than the path MTU, the sending node splits the packet into fragments.

TCP - layer 4 - Transmission Control Protocol (20 bytes)
	Src port (16 bits)

	Dest port (16 bits)

	Seq number (32 bits)
		If the SYN flag is set (1), then this is the initial sequence number. The sequence number
		of the actual first data byte and the acknowledged number in the corresponding ACK are
		then this sequence number plus 1.

		If the SYN flag is clear (0), then this is the accumulated sequence number of the first
		data byte of this segment for the current session.

	Ack number (32 bits)

	Data offset (4 bits)
		The minimum size header is 5 words and the maximum is 15 words thus giving the minimum size
		of 20 bytes and maximum of 60 bytes, allowing for up to 40 bytes of options in the header.

	Reserved (3 bits)

	Flags (9 bits)
		NS (1 bit): ECN-nonce - concealment protection (experimental: see RFC 3540).

		CWR (1 bit): Congestion Window Reduced (CWR) flag is set by the sending host to indicate
			that it received a TCP segment with the ECE flag set and had responded in 
			congestion control mechanism (added to header by RFC 3168).

		ECE (1 bit): ECN-Echo has a dual role, depending on the value of the SYN flag. It indicates:
			If the SYN flag is set (1), that the TCP peer is ECN capable.
			If the SYN flag is clear (0), that a packet with Congestion Experienced flag set
			(ECN=11) in the IP header was received during normal transmission (added to header
			by RFC 3168). This serves as an indication of network congestion (or impending
			congestion) to the TCP sender.

		URG (1 bit): indicates that the Urgent pointer field is significant

		ACK (1 bit): indicates that the Acknowledgment field is significant. All packets
			after the initial SYN packet sent by the client should have this flag set.

		PSH (1 bit): Push function. Asks to push the buffered data to the receiving application.

		RST (1 bit): Reset the connection

		SYN (1 bit): Synchronize sequence numbers. Only the first packet sent from each end 
			should have this flag set. Some other flags and fields change meaning based
			on this flag, and some are only valid when it is set, and others when it is clear.

		FIN (1 bit): Last packet from sender.

	Window size (16 bits)
		The size of the receive window, which specifies the number of window size units (by default, bytes) 

	Checksum (16 bits)
	
	Urgent pointer (16 bits)
		if the URG flag is set, then this 16-bit field is an offset from the sequence number indicating
		the last urgent data byte.

	Options (0-320 bits)
		Some options may only be sent when SYN is set; they are indicated below as [SYN]. Option-Kind
		and standard lengths given as (Option-Kind,Option-Length).

			0 (8 bits): End of options list
			1 (8 bits): No operation (NOP, Padding) This may be used to align option fields on
				32-bit boundaries for better performance.
			2,4,SS (32 bits): Maximum segment size (see maximum segment size) [SYN]
			3,3,S (24 bits): Window scale (see window scaling for details) [SYN][7]
			4,2 (16 bits): Selective Acknowledgement permitted. [SYN] (See selective acknowledgments for details)[8]
			5,N,BBBB,EEEE,... (variable bits, N is either 10, 18, 26, or 34)- Selective ACKnowledgement
				(SACK)[9] These first two bytes are followed by a list of 1–4 blocks being selectively
				acknowledged, specified as 32-bit begin/end pointers.
			8,10,TTTT,EEEE (80 bits)- Timestamp and echo of previous timestamp (see TCP timestamps for details)[10]

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol
Two computers in an office (computer 1 and computer 2) are connected to each other 
in a local area network by Ethernet cables and network switches, with no intervening
gateways or routers. Computer 1 has a packet to send to Computer 2. Through DNS, it
determines that Computer 2 has the IP address 192.168.0.55. To send the message, it
also requires Computer 2's MAC address. First, Computer 1 uses a cached ARP table to
look up 192.168.0.55 for any existing records of Computer 2's MAC address (00:eb:24:b2:05:ac).
If the MAC address is found, it sends an Ethernet frame with destination address
00:eb:24:b2:05:ac, containing the IP packet onto the link. If the cache did not produce
a result for 192.168.0.55, Computer 1 has to send a broadcast ARP message
(destination FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF MAC address), which is accepted by all computers on
the local network, requesting an answer for 192.168.0.55. Computer 2 responds with
its MAC and IP addresses. Computer 2 may insert an entry for Computer 1 into its ARP
table for future use. Computer 1 caches the response information in its ARP table and
can now send the packet.

Path MTU Discovery
	Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) is a standardized technique in computer 
	networking for determining the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size on
	the network path between two Internet Protocol (IP) hosts, usually with
	the goal of avoiding IP fragmentation. 

	For IPv4 packets, Path MTU Discovery works by setting the Don't Fragment
	(DF) flag bit in the IP headers of outgoing packets. Then, any device 
	along the path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop it, and
	send back an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Fragmentation 
	Needed (Type 3, Code 4) message containing its MTU, allowing the source
	host to reduce its Path MTU appropriately. The process is repeated until
	the MTU is small enough to traverse the entire path without fragmentation.

Virtual Extensible LAN - VxLAN
	is a proposed encapsulation protocol for running an overlay network
	on existing Layer 3 infrastructure. An overlay network is a virtual

Border Gateway Protocol - BGP
	is a standardized exterior gateway protocol to exhange routing 
	and reachability information among systems (AS) on the internet.
