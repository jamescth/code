For a given set of software checkins, write a 
program that will determine which part along 
the branch where the fault lies.  

Talk about an iostat output (what does user vs system cpu load mean,
what does iowait% mean, cache vs buffers, why do we need caching,
how much cache is needed, how can disk performance be improved,
where is the bottleneck)
How do TCP, UDP work? Describe what happens when a client opens
a web page. How does DNS work? How does HTTP work? How does a
router work?
Various questions about your current experience, talk about a
conflict situation and how you handled it.
How would you design a system that manipulates content sent
from a client (e.g. clean bad words in a comment post)?

Write a function to sort a list of integers that looks
like this [5,2,0,3,0,1,6,0] -&gt; [1,2,3,5,6,0,0,0]
in the most efficient way.

use heap, get the largest num
if v > 0
	ret = append([]int{v}, ret...}
if v == 0
	ret = append(ret, 0)

With very little detailed information, how would you
approach tackling a performance problem in a web
application (i.e., step through your thought process
of what steps you would take, information you would
seek, etc.)

Explain everything that happens over the network when a client tries to access a website.

Explain in every single step about what will happen after you type " ls * " in your terminal.

HTTP port = 80
HTTPs Port = 443
DNS port = 43
SSH Port = 22
FTP = 21

Given a list of words, create a master list that has sublists that contain anagrams.
	what defines an anagram: two words are anagrams of each other if they consist
	of the same set of letters and each letter appears exactly the same number or
	time in both words. 

Simple comparison between numbers given constraints see how many comparisons are true.

# You will be supplied with two data files in CSV format. The first file contains
# statistics about various dinosaurs. The second file contains additional data.
#
# Given the following formula,
#
# speed = ((STRIDE_LENGTH / LEG_LENGTH) - 1) * SQRT(LEG_LENGTH * g)
# Where g = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational constant)
#
# Write a program to read in the data files from disk, it must then print the names
# of only the bipedal dinosaurs from fastest to slowest. Do not print any other information.

# $ cat dataset1.csv
# NAME,LEG_LENGTH,DIET
# Hadrosaurus,1.4,herbivore
# Struthiomimus,0.72,omnivore
# Velociraptor,1.8,carnivore
# Triceratops,0.47,herbivore
# Euoplocephalus,2.6,herbivore
# Stegosaurus,1.50,herbivore
# Tyrannosaurus Rex,6.5,carnivore

# $ cat dataset2.csv
# NAME,STRIDE_LENGTH,STANCE
# Euoplocephalus,1.97,quadrupedal
# Stegosaurus,1.70,quadrupedal
# Tyrannosaurus Rex,4.76,bipedal
# Hadrosaurus,1.3,bipedal
# Deinonychus,1.11,bipedal
