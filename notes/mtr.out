This uses the report option, which sends 10 packets to the host google.com and generates a report. 

Each numbered line in the report represents a hop.

The Loss% column shows the percentage of packet loss at each hop. The Snt column counts the
number of packets sent. The --report option will send 10 packets unless specified with
--report-cycles=[number-of-packets], where [number-of-packets] represents the total number
of packets that you want to send to the remote host.

The next four columns Last, Avg, Best, and Wrst are all measurements of latency in
milliseconds (e.g. ms). Last is the latency of the last packet sent, Avg is average latency
of all packets, while Best and Wrst display the best (shortest) and worst (longest) round
trip time for a packet to this host. In most cases, the average (Avg) column should be 
the focus of your attention.

The final column, StDev, provides the standard deviation of the latencies to each host. 
The higher the standard deviation, the greater the difference is between measurements 
of latency.
